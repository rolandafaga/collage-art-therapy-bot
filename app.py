If you feel overwhelmed by anger, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out and get help. CBT for anger management is structured, directive and can teach you coping strategies to manage triggers in an adaptive way. Remember, anger should not be suppressed. Rather, it should be communicated in an assertive, healthy way.")
